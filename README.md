# Python_projects
This is a repository for mini projects done in Python. **Sentimentizer** is the first larger project to be included in the repository.

# Sentimentizer
**Sentimentizer** classifies the polarity of a given text without the use of Python *NLTK* package. In the first analysis, the number of postive and negative words is discerned. While the second analysis allows for the inclusion of stopwords, the third analysis includes the possibility of running a comparative analysis of two *.txt* files or manually typed-in text input.

## Modules necessary to run the program:
- **pyfiglet**
- **termcolor**
- **matplotlib**
- **collections**
